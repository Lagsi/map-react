Diese Aufnahmen machen sprachlos. Suche Russische Frauen haben offenbar die Beerdigung für Joe Biden inszeniert. Bild: picture alliance/dpa/AP | Andrew Harnik Die Spannungen zwischen dem Westen und Russland sind in den vergangenen Monaten durch den Ukraine-Krieg immer weiter gewachsen. In Europa entsteht allem Anschein nach ein neuer Eiserner Vorhang. Die USA gehören derweil zu den schärfsten Kritikern von Kreml-Chef Wladimir Putin. Der amerikanische Präsident Joe Biden bezeichnete ihn zum Beispiel schon als \"Kriegsverbrecher\". Mit einer geschmacklosen Aktion wurde jetzt in Russland erneut gegen das US-Staatsoberhaupt geschossen. Joe Biden Beerdigung inszeniert von drei russischen Frauen Der belarussische Oppositionskanal veröffentlichte auf Twitter ein Video, auf dem zu sehen ist, wie drei ältere russische Damen eine Beerdigung für Joe Biden inszenieren. Ein Schwarz-Weiß-Bild des US-Präsidenten wurde an einem Kreuz angebracht. Ein konkretes Todesdatum wird darauf nicht angegeben, es ist die Aufschrift \"1942-202?\" zu erkennen. Zwei bunte Kränze wurden außerdem für die Pseudo-Beisetzung vorbereitet. Die Frauen bezeichnen in dem Video Joe Biden als böse, Mörder und Kriegstreiber. Ob die Aufnahmen echt sind und woher sie konkret stammen, ist unklar. Women from #Russia organized a funeral for Joe #Biden. pic.twitter.com/qi6mCGxmPg— NEXTA (@nexta_tv) November 24, 2022 \"Propaganda, Propaganda\": Twitter entsetzt von geschmackloser Aktion gegen US-Präsidenten Ein Twitter-User vermutet zu dem Clip: \"Der geheime russische Biden-Fanclub war gezwungen, seine Aktivitäten einzustellen und ein Begräbnis für sein Idol zu veranstalten... andernfalls drohten die russischen Behörden den 3 Grupies mit 15 Jahren Gefängnis wegen unerlaubter feuchter Träume mit dem Feind!\". Auch ein anderer Nutzer glaubt: \"Propaganda, Propaganda. Ohne jemandem zu nahe treten zu wollen, glaube ich nicht, dass diese Leute den US-Präsidenten kannten, und sie gingen mit gekauften Kränzen und der Möglichkeit, Geld zu bekommen, dorthin, und zusätzlich, dass sie fotografiert wurden.\" Ein weiterer Kommentar zu dem Video lautet: \"Was ist mit ihren Söhnen? Keine Beerdigung für sie? Oh, das geht nicht, weil die Russen sie in der Ukraine verrotten ließen.\" Und in diesem Tweet heißt es: \"Wenn ich sie sehe, schwankt mein Herz zwischen dem aufrichtigen Mitleid, das ich für diese alten Damen empfinde, die durch jahrelange Propaganda manipuliert wurden, und einer immensen Wut auf diejenigen, die ein solches Regime des Terrorismus und des Hasses unterstützen.\" Lesen Sie auch: Peinliches Schweigen im TV!

      "summary": "On Wednesday, Elon Musk promised that he would make public the behind-the-scenes conversations at Twitter in 2020 regarding the social media giant's decision to censor the New York Post's bombshell report on the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop, material that has been verified by establishment media in recent weeks. Twitter user ALX wrote, \"Raise your hand if you think @ElonMusk should make public all internal discussions about the decision to censor the @NYPost's story on Hunter Biden's laptop before the 2020 Election in the interest of Transparency.\" Musk replied, \"This is necessary to restore public trust.\" On October 14, 2020, the New York Post ran a scathing story that reported on emails found on Hunter Biden's discarded laptop that revealed the link between Presidential hopeful Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, Ukrainian energy giant Burisma, and actions taken by Biden during his time as VP to secure positive outcomes in Ukraine for his son's endeavors. The report also revealed that Joe Biden held $1 billion in funds to Ukraine hostage until that government dismissed a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, where Biden's son served on the board. Weeks before the presidential election, Twitter labeled the article \"potentially harmful\" and blocked the content when users would try and share it. In the two years since that tweet, Hunter Biden's \"laptop from hell\" has been authenticated from multiple outlets, including the New York Times and CBS News. Revelations from Hunter Biden's \"laptop from hell\" have confirmed that Joe Biden's son was engaged in suspicious business partnerships in Ukraine and China for years, earned more than $11 million, and made deals that allegedly resulted in significant financial kickbacks to Joe Biden. This year President Biden sold 1 million barrels of oil from the US Strategic Reserves to a Chinese company Hunter Biden invested in. Joe Biden was also fingered as \"the big guy\" by Hunter's associates which connected him to a deal where the president gained a 10 percent equity stake in another Chinese company, CEFC. The laptop's contents implicate Joe Biden and his son in corruption connected with influence peddling and profiteering compounded by Hunter Biden's love for hookers, illegal guns, and crack. A poll released in March indicated that 16 percent of voters who were unaware of the laptop scandal would have not voted for Biden had they known about it at the time.",

      "summary": "Ce mardi 29 novembre 2022, Joe Biden accueille Emmanuel Macron pour une visite d'Etat officielle de quatre jours. Si le président américain doit soigner les relations avec l'Elysée, il doit aussi défendre ses propres intérêts. \nSommaire Joe Biden déroule le tapis rouge à Emmanuel Macron en virée à Washington ce mardi 29 novembre 2022 et pour quatre jours. Première visite d'Etat aux Etats-Unis depuis l'installation de Joe Biden à la Maison Blanche, la rencontre crée l'événement et revêt de nombreux enjeux économiques, mais aussi géopolitiques et environnementaux. Si sur certains les visions des deux chefs d'Etat se rejoignent, sur d'autres un bras de fer courtois pourrait s'organiser entre la Maison Blanche et l'Élysée. Joe Biden a tout intérêt à ce que la visite de son homologue français glisse sans encombre, mais est aussi poussé à tenir certaines de ses positions, à commencer par celle sur l'Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (loi de réduction de l'inflation en 2022). Du sérieux des discussions tenues dans le Bureau ovale à l'intimité et les échanges informels lors du dîner présidentiel prévu en présence des deux Premières dames, Jill Biden et Brigitte Macron, rien ne sera laissé au hasard entre les deux présidents. Joe Biden et la défense de l'Inflation Reduction Act Si le président américain souhaite que la visite d'Emmanuel Macron se déroule sans accroc, il ne compte pas s'aplatir devant le chef d'Etat français, en particulier sur le point central de cette rencontre : les négociations sur l'Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). La loi votée le 16 août 2022 prévoit des aides massives -un peu plus de 430 milliards de dollars- pour les Américains consommant des produits de fabrication 100% américaine, notamment par le biais de crédit d'impôt. La mesure, essentielle pour le bilan de Joe Biden qui n'a plus que deux ans pour honorer ses promesses de campagne, n'est pas vue d'un bon œil par l'Union européenne dont Emmanuel Macron se fait le porte-voix à l'occasion de sa visite à Washington. Alors que la Commission de Bruxelles juge la loi protectionniste et en mesure \"de menacer l'emploi et la croissance économique en Europe et ailleurs\", rapporte Le Figaro, le chef d'Etat français entend demander à son homologue américain des exemptions, purement et simplement. Joe Biden a assuré par l'intermédiaire de son porte-parole, John Kirby, être \"prêt à avoir cette conversation et à trouver un moyen d'aborder ces inquiétudes\", mais ira-t-il jusqu'à contrevenir à sa propre loi au profit de quelques industries européennes ? Les négociations s'annoncent tendues. Soigner les relations franco-américaines Malgré les intérêts opposés de Washington et de Paris sur la question de l'IRA, Joe Biden souhaite apaiser les relations franco-américaines. Les échanges entre les deux pays ne sont pas au beau fixe depuis l'élection du président américain et la crise sur le contrat des sous-marins avec l'Australie. En 2021, la Maison Blanche, acoquinée avec le Royaume-Uni et l'île continent, avait ravi un contrat juteux sur la fabrication et la livraison de sous-marins militaires sur lequel l'Hexagone s'était positionné. Emmanuel Macron n'avait pas apprécié cette mise à l'écart de la zone stratégique de l'Indopacifique. Mais pour Joe Biden, la visite d'Etat du président français est l'occasion de faire table rase et de resserrer les liens. Cette coopération doit s'étendre sur plusieurs domaines, eux aussi stratégiques : le nucléaire, le spatial ou encore la biodiversité. Des domaines d'avenir dans lesquels les Etats-Unis veulent se réserver une place de leader.  Entre front commun et leadership sur la guerre en Ukraine La guerre en Ukraine sera inévitablement au cœur des discussions entre Joe Biden et Emmanuel Macron. Les deux chefs d'Etat se sont positionnés comme deux grands alliés de Kiev mais ont jusqu'à présent défendu des positions un tantinet différentes, Washington étant moins enclin à discuter avec Moscou que l'Élysée qui s'est emparée du rôle de médiateur et plaide pour des négociations entre les deux belligérants. Joe Biden pourrait toutefois revoir sa position alors qu'une ouverture pour la tenue de discussions entre Kiev et Moscou semble avoir été repérée par le chef d'état-major américain, le général Mark Milley, comme le rapporte Franceinfo. En participant massivement à l'envoi de matériel militaire en Ukraine, le président américain s'est assuré de peser lourd dans ce conflit et ne veut pas perdre son rôle déterminant et dominant. L'alignement des Etats-Unis et de l'Europe sur une même stratégie est, là encore, un moyen pour Joe Biden de resserrer les liens à l'heure où le bloc russe cherche à se rapprocher de l'Europe.",

And while some Republicans say they're supportive of the amount, many more have been cautious to take a position just yet. 'It's a lot of money. I think we'll have to have an open discussion on it,' Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, said on Tuesday, shortly after the request was made public.\nWhile there is broad support for Ukraine military assistance among Republicans in both chambers, there has also been resistance about other forms of aid and how it's being accounted for.  (read more)\n\n\nPosted in Big Government, Big Stupid Government, Decepticons, Deep State, Dem Hypocrisy, European Union, Joe Biden, Legislation, media bias, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, NATO, propaganda, Russia, Ukraine, Uncategorized",

      "summary": "President Biden and scandal-plagued first son Hunter Biden went shopping Friday on Nantucket amid a federal investigation of the first family's overseas business deals — as House Republicans vow a parallel probe to unearth Joe Biden's role in his brother and son's foreign consulting work.\nThe president, 80, and his 52-year-old son visited several small businesses on the exclusive Massachusetts island after Joe Biden lunched at a restaurant called Brotherhood of Thieves — apparently without Hunter, according to pool reports.\nHunter Biden and his father popped into shops, including Craftmasters of Nantucket, before attending the island's annual Christmas tree lighting festival, where Hunter then stood alongside his dad to greet eventgoers.\nThe Biden family is staying — likely for free — at the home of private-equity billionaire David Rubenstein, who also lent his $20 million compound to the president last Thanksgiving.\nThe trip to Nantucket follows Hunter Biden's frequent visits to the White House in the run-up to House Republicans retaking power in January. Also this month, he attended the traditional pre-Thanksgiving turkey pardon days after his eldest child, Naomi Biden, got married at the White House.\nJoe Biden allegedly was involved to some degree with many of Hunter's influence-peddling gigs overseas, especially in countries where the elder Biden held sway as vice president from 2009 to 2017, such as China and Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPresident Biden makes a funny face as he greets his grandson, Hunter's son Beau.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAP Photo/Susan Walsh\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBiden stopped at several businesses after going out to lunch in Nantucket.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPhoto by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHunter Biden did not join his father for lunch at Brotherhood of Thieves.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHunter Biden's wife Melissa Cohen walks with their son, Beau, and the president.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPhoto by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHunter handing his son Beau a drink in Nantucket.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPhoto by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Bidens' public appearance comes at the House GOP prepares to launch a corruption probe into the family.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incoming chairman of the House oversight committee, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), said at a press conference last week that his panel would use its power to subpoena testimony and evidence to 'evaluate whether this president is compromised or swayed by foreign dollars.'\n'This is an investigation of Joe Biden,' Comer said.\nHunter Biden confirmed in late 2020 that he's under federal investigation for possible tax fraud. One of his associates, Hollywood lawyer Kevin Morris, recently paid the IRS about $2 million on the first son's behalf, though the terms of that arrangement remain murky and paying off the debt doesn't prevent criminal charges for the original non-payment.\nThe FBI also reportedly is investigating Hunter Biden for possible money laundering, illegal foreign lobby and lying about his drug use on a gun-purchase form. The investigators report to the US attorney's office in Delaware. Attorney General Merrick Garland has resisted calls to appoint a special counsel to insulate the probe from political pressure — despite naming a special counsel last week to oversee a pair of investigations into former President Donald Trump.\nBiden has a drink while out to lunch at Brotherhood of Thieves on Nantucket with his wife, first kady Jill Biden, and their daughter Ashley Biden.Nantucket Current\nThe president has been a recurring figure in his family's overseas business venture — despite claiming he's 'never' spoken to his son about his foreign income — according to records from a laptop that Hunter Biden abandoned in 2019 at a Delaware repair shop, in addition to other reporting.\nIn China, Hunter Biden co-founded an investment firm called BHR Partners in 2013 within weeks of joining then-Vice President Biden aboard Air Force Two on an official trip to Beijing, according to the Wall Street Journal. Hunter introduced his dad to incoming BHR CEO Jonathan Li in a hotel lobby and Joe Biden later wrote college recommendation letters for Li's children. Online business records indicate that Hunter Biden still co-owns a 10% stake in BHR, despite his father's insistence there would be no family-business-related conflicts of interest during his presidency.\nJoe Biden allegedly was involved with a second Chinese venture as well. Hunter and first brother Jim Biden earned $4.8 million from CEFC China Energy — an arm of Beijing's foreign-influence 'Belt and Road' initiative — in 2017 and 2018, according to the Washington Post's review of Hunter Biden laptop documents. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Biden family is staying at the home of private-equity billionaire David Rubenstein.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPhoto by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPresident Biden and first lady Jill Biden at a tree lighting ceremony with Hunter and Beau on Nantucket.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nREUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBiden hugs his wife and daughter.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe president and Hunter wave to the crowd at the event.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPhoto by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMelissa Cohen and Ashley Biden also attended the tree lighting.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAP\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Hunter Biden business partner Tony Bobulinski says he met with Joe Biden in May 2017 to discuss the CEFC deal and a May 2017 email from another associate, James Gilliar, says the 'big guy' was due a 10% cut. Bobulinski and Gilliar have identified Joe Biden as the 'big guy.'\nIn Ukraine, Hunter Biden received up to $1 million per year to serve on the board of the energy company Burisma — despite no relevant industry experience — as his vice-president dad led the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House visitor logs show that Joe Biden met with his son's partner Devon Archer in 2014 around the time both Hunter Biden and Archer joined the Burisma board. Joe Biden attended a 2015 DC dinner apparently attended by Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi, who wrote Hunter an email the next day thanking him for the 'opportunity to meet your father.'\nHunter invited other international associates to the 2015 dinner with his father, who was the sitting vice president at the time. Laptop records indicate he also invited Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina and her husband, ex-Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov. Baturina is one of a dwindling number of Russian oligarchs yet to face US sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. She paid $3.5 million in 2014 to a Hunter Biden-linked firm, according to a 2020 report from GOP-led Senate committees.\nPhotos and emails from Hunter Biden's laptop also indicate that Joe Biden in 2015 hosted his son and a group of Mexican business associates at the vice president's official residence. Joe and Hunter Biden posed for a group photo with Mexican billionaires Carlos Slim and Miguel Alemán Velasco. \nIn 2016, Hunter Biden emailed Alemán's son, apparently from Air Force Two while joining his dad for an official visit to Mexico, complaining that he hadn't received reciprocal business favors after 'I have brought every single person you have ever asked me to bring to the F'ing White House and the Vice President's house and the inauguration.'\nSince Joe Biden became president, Hunter launched an art career seeking as much as $500,000 for his novice works. \nThe White House developed a plan for those art sales to be 'anonymous' to theoretically prevent possible influence-peddling. Hunter received at least $375,000 last year for five prints at a Los Angeles art show attended by one of his father's ambassador nominees, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. It's unclear how many other sales he may have made.",

Le Président français et Joe Biden devraient aborder plusieurs sujets stratégiques, comme la guerre en Ukraine, les prix du gaz et la concurrence déloyale.\n Emmanuel Macron doit atterrir à Washington, dans la soirée du mardi 29 novembre, pour effectuer sa deuxième visite d'État sur le sol américain. La première s'était déroulée sous le mandat de Donald Trump. Cette fois-ci, il va rencontrer Joe Biden. Si certains pensent qu'il s'agit là d'un moyen de se faire pardonner la vente annulée des sous-marins par l'Australie en 2021, des diplomates assurent que cette invitation s'inscrit dans le partenariat stratégique entre les deux pays. La guerre en Ukraine devrait une fois de plus se trouver au centre des discussions. L'importance au niveau diplomatique et politique que possède la France sur le sol européen est fortement appréciée outre-Atlantique. \"La France est vraiment un partenaire majeur en Europe. Il y a une volonté d'avoir la France à bord\", décrypte Marie Jourdain, chercheuse à l'Atlantic Council. Aussi, les prix du gaz et la concurrence déloyale devraient être discutés durant la visite d'Emmanuel Macron.

      "summary": "President of France Emmanuel Macron is set to be hosted by US President Joe Biden this week, as the two leaders will discuss a slew of raging issues including strategy amid the Russia-Ukraine war and China to ease trade and economic tensions.   This is the first meeting between the French President and President Joe Biden since the bilateral diplomatic relations between the two nations went sour after Washington's sale of nuclear submarines to Australia.   What is the agenda? The French President will begin his visit on Wednesday in a meeting with the Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris at NASA's headquarters in Washington. The meeting will focus on a discussion of issues related to bilateral cooperation in space. President Emmanuel Macron will also attend a working lunch at NASA headquarters on issues relating to climate and biodiversity with members of Congress.   Furthermore, as per the White House, US Vice President along with US State Secretary Antony Blinken will also host a state luncheon for Macron and his family on Thursday. White House Spokesperson John Kirby said it is \"an opportunity to highlight a foundational component of this administration's approach to foreign policy - and that's through alliances.\" In addition to holding bilateral talks with President Biden, Macron's tour includes a visit to New Orleans later in the week.   China and Ukraine being given priority Amid the bilateral meeting between President Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, US officials say they are expected to discuss topics including Ukraine, Iran's nuclear program and China's growing presence in the Indo-Pacific region, reported Sputkin.   \"I think China will be on the very top of the agenda between the two leaders,\" one US official stated Monday. \"Europe has its interests - our views on China are not identical but I think there is a strong view that we should be speaking from a common script in response to China.\"  Moreover, various US officials have also stated that Russia's war against Ukraine will be \"front and centre\" during the meeting at the Oval Office, with both presidents working to maintain economic and military support for Kyiv.   A substantive conversation on economic and energy security elements has also been scheduled and will include the increased supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe by the United States ahead of the coming winter, green energy, 'unfair' Chinese trade practices, and the European Union's concern that the Inflation Reduction Act is diverting investment away from Europe, the US official said.",

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) by: HOPE YEN, Associated Press Posted: Nov 28, 2022 / 04:51 AM CST Updated: Nov 28, 2022 / 10:31 AM CST WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is strengthening U.S. policy aimed at stemming sexual violence in war conflict zones, elevating the problem — increasingly documented in Ukraine and elsewhere — to the level of a possible serious human rights abuse that triggers sanctions and other actions against foreign perpetrators. Biden on Monday signed a presidential memorandum that seeks to combat the use of rape by both foreign governments and individuals as a weapon of war. The memorandum directs for the first time that the State and Treasury departments and other agencies give equal consideration of acts of sexual violence to other serious human rights abuses in leveraging sanctions and other punishment against foreign actors. Currently, U.S. policy allows for the imposition of sanctions for conflict-related sexual violence, but it is not commonly used. Biden's action comes when the United Nations has warned that sexual violence in Ukraine, especially against women and girls, remains prevalent and underreported. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield has previously cited 'a mountain of credible reports of atrocities committed by Russia's forces against civilians,' including 'horrific accounts of sexual violence.' The Biden administration on Monday pointed to a proliferation of sexual violence cases in Ukraine, Ethiopia and elsewhere. It cited a U.N. report that found 3,293 verified sexual violence cases in 2021 across 18 countries, an increase of about 800 compared with the previous year. The U.N. has estimated that for each rape reported in connection with a conflict, about 10 to 20 cases go undocumented. The administration had previously pledged $400,000 in addition to its annual contribution of $1.75 million to the Office of the U.N. Special Representative to the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. The State Department plans an added investment of $5.5 million over the next two years to civil society projects and survivor groups seeking sexual violence accountability and will expand programs to help survivors and investigate and document acts of such violence.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) by: HOPE YEN, Associated Press Posted: Nov 28, 2022 / 05:51 AM EST Updated: Nov 28, 2022 / 11:32 AM EST WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is strengthening U.S. policy aimed at stemming sexual violence in war conflict zones, elevating the problem — increasingly documented in Ukraine and elsewhere — to the level of a possible serious human rights abuse that triggers sanctions and other actions against foreign perpetrators. Biden on Monday signed a presidential memorandum that seeks to combat the use of rape by both foreign governments and individuals as a weapon of war. The memorandum directs for the first time that the State and Treasury departments and other agencies give equal consideration of acts of sexual violence to other serious human rights abuses in leveraging sanctions and other punishment against foreign actors. Currently, U.S. policy allows for the imposition of sanctions for conflict-related sexual violence, but it is not commonly used. Biden's action comes when the United Nations has warned that sexual violence in Ukraine, especially against women and girls, remains prevalent and underreported. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield has previously cited 'a mountain of credible reports of atrocities committed by Russia's forces against civilians,' including 'horrific accounts of sexual violence.' The Biden administration on Monday pointed to a proliferation of sexual violence cases in Ukraine, Ethiopia and elsewhere. It cited a U.N. report that found 3,293 verified sexual violence cases in 2021 across 18 countries, an increase of about 800 compared with the previous year. The U.N. has estimated that for each rape reported in connection with a conflict, about 10 to 20 cases go undocumented. The administration had previously pledged $400,000 in addition to its annual contribution of $1.75 million to the Office of the U.N. Special Representative to the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. The State Department plans an added investment of $5.5 million over the next two years to civil society projects and survivor groups seeking sexual violence accountability and will expand programs to help survivors and investigate and document acts of such violence.

      "summary": "Emmanuel Macron arrives in the United States on Tuesday for his second state visit since his election at the Elysée. On the program: the war in Ukraine and Franco-American relations. It was also an opportunity to strengthen ties after the quarrel that followed the sale of Australian submarines to Washington.\n\nAlexis Gilleux with AFP 07:36, November 29, 2022\n\nEmmanuel Macron arrives in the United States on Tuesday for his second state visit since his election at the Elysée.\n\nOn the program: the war in Ukraine and Franco-American relations.\n\nIt was also an opportunity to strengthen ties after the quarrel that followed the sale of Australian submarines to Washington.\n\nEmmanuel Macron is going to Washington on Tuesday for his second state visit, an \"honor\" which he hopes to take advantage of to push his diplomatic plea on the war in Ukraine and raise his voice against American protectionism.\n\nThe Americans will do everything to prevent the slightest friction or a little fresh statement from tarnishing the first state visit organized by Joe Biden.\n\nThe French president will be entitled Thursday to all the pomp and all the honors of such a reception, with cannon shots, gala dinner and fireside chat in the famous Oval Office.\n\nJohn Kirby, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, on Monday praised this \"dynamic\" French president whose country, a nuclear power, is \"at the center\" of all global issues, be it the war in Ukraine or the rise of China.\n\nJoe Biden \"felt that it was really the most relevant country\" to organize the first state visit since his inauguration, concluded the adviser.\n\n>> Find Europe Matin in replay and podcast here\n\nIn 2018, Donald Trump invited his young counterpart for a highly publicized meeting.\n\nThis one will be less so: Emmanuel Macron is no longer a novelty, and the octogenarian Democrat fascinates less than the Republican billionaire.\n\nBut Paris is not sulking its pleasure, before a trip which will begin Tuesday evening in Washington, and will then take the French president to New Orleans.\n\nIt is \"an honor that is done to France rather than to any other European country\", we welcome, on the French side.\n\nEverything will be done to settle a recent Franco-American crisis, with solemn declarations and more intimate exchanges also involving the wives of the two presidents, Jill Biden and Brigitte Macron.\n\nBetween Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, it got off to a bad start: in September 2021, Washington's announcement of the AUKUS alliance with Australia and the United Kingdom aroused the ire of Paris, deprived of a mega-contract of sub -sailors with Canberra.\n\nBut also upset to have been kept away in a key region, \"the Indo-Pacific\".\n\nThis visit, \"is a bit like the comet tail of AUKUS\" and the rapprochement launched since, explains Célia Belin, guest researcher at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\nAccording to her, the Americans have an interest in keeping a close link with this ally which advocates the \"strategic autonomy\" of Europe.\n\n\"The French are not always easy to manage, but when the French and Americans come to an agreement, it makes a lot of progress.\"\n\n\"Not Allies Aligned\"\n\nBeyond the protocol, the Elysee therefore hopes to have a \"demanding\" dialogue.\n\n\"We are not aligned allies,\" notes a presidential adviser.\n\nFirst on Ukraine.\n\nSince the Russian invasion, Emmanuel Macron has been playing a little music that has long annoyed the American partner: total support for kyiv, but also dialogue with Moscow so that, when the Ukrainians decide, the war ends \"around the table of negotiations\".\n\nThe French head of state continues to reconcile this diplomatic \"at the same time\" by organizing a conference in Paris on December 13 in support of the civil resistance of Ukraine while promising to speak again, \"in the coming days\". , to Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut Washington seems to be getting closer to this position since its chief of staff, General Mark Milley, mentioned a possible window of opportunity for negotiations.\n\nBut Emmanuel Macron also wants a \"resynchronization\" of the economic response, on both sides of the Atlantic, to the crisis caused by the conflict and, more broadly, in terms of ecological transition and competition with China.\n\nOn this last point, crucial for Joe Biden who sees the rivalry with Beijing as his main axis of foreign policy, a senior White House official acknowledged that the positions of the Americans and the Europeans were not \"identical\", but that all shared the desire to \"play a common score in response to China.\"\n\n>> READ ALSO -\n\nG7: Unease between Emmanuel Macron and Joe Biden in front of the cameras\n\nThe main sticking point is expected to be commercial: Paris is seeking a way out of the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" (IRA), which provides for massive investments for the energy transition - accompanied by generous subsidies for electric vehicles, batteries and renewable energies produced in UNITED STATES.\n\n\"We will not sit idly by\" in the face of this investment plan deemed protectionist, assured French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.\n\nThe White House wants to calm things down: \"We are completely ready to have this conversation and find a way to address these concerns,\" said John Kirby.\n\nIf President Macron hopes to obtain \"exemptions\" for a few European industries, he knows that it is unlikely that Joe Biden will reconsider the architecture of this crucial plan for his balance sheet.\n\nThe idea is therefore rather to learn the lessons to go and defend a similar policy with the Europeans.",

Damit solle die Ukraine bei der Selbstverteidigung unter anderem gegen Russlands \"unbarmherzige Angriffe\" auf die Energie-Infrastruktur des Landes unterstützt werden. \"Wir werden die Ukraine so lange wie nötig weiter unterstützen, damit sie sich weiter verteidigen kann und am Verhandlungstisch in der stärkstmöglichen Position ist, wenn die Zeit dafür kommt\", erklärte Blinken. Den Angaben zufolge haben die USA seit dem Amtsantritt von Präsident Joe Biden im Januar 2021 der Ukraine Militärhilfen in Höhe von 19,7 Milliarden Dollar zur Verfügung gestellt. AFP #Themen",

      "summary": "Der Milliardär und Twitter-Chef Elon Musk plant offenbar, vollständig offenzulegen, was im Jahr 2020 zu der Entscheidung von Twitter geführt hat, einen Artikel über die Geschäfte von Hunter Biden im Zusammenhang mit der Präsidentschaftswahl 2020 zu zensieren. Dies sei laut Musk notwendig, \"um das öffentliche Vertrauen wiederherzustellen.\" Quelle: www.globallookpress.com © www.imago-images.deAls die New York Post auf dem Höhepunkt des US-Präsidentschaftswahlkampfs im Jahr 2020 einen Artikel veröffentlichte, der den damaligen Präsidentschaftskandidaten Joe Biden mit den Geschäften seines Sohnes Hunter in der Ukraine in Verbindung brachte, unterband der US-Kurznachrichtendienst Twitter kurzerhand die Verbreitung sämtlicher Weblinks zu dem Artikel. Unter anderem konnte der Text daraufhin nicht mehr per Tweet oder Direktnachricht weitergeleitet werden. Besonders unter den US-Republikanern sorgte das Vorgehen des Konzerns damals für Unbehagen. Viele fragten sich, ob Twitter mit der Zensur der Geschichte möglicherweise illegale Wahlkampfhilfe für Joe Biden betreibe.   Nun könnte Licht in die ominöse Angelegenheit kommen. Am Mittwoch ließ Twitter-Chef Elon Musk nämlich verlauten, dass sein Unternehmen möglicherweise Details über die unrechtmäßige Zensur des Artikels über den Biden-Laptop veröffentlichen werde. Seiner Auffassung nach sollte die interne Kommunikation des Twitter-Vorstands vor der Entscheidung des Unternehmens, die brisante Geschichte der New York Post zu zensieren, veröffentlicht werden. Mit seinen Andeutungen reagierte Musk auf einen Twitter-Post von US-Nachrichtensprecher Alex Lorusso, in dem dieser den neuen Twitter-Chef aufforderte, \"alle internen Diskussionen\" im Zusammenhang mit der Sperrung der Laptop-Story vor den Präsidentschaftswahlen im Jahr 2020 zu veröffentlichen.\"Heben Sie die Hand, wenn Sie denken, dass Musk im Interesse der Transparenz alle internen Diskussionen über die Entscheidung, die Geschichte der New York Post über Hunter Bidens Laptop vor der Wahl 2020 zu zensieren, veröffentlichen sollte\", schrieb Lorusso auf Twitter.Musk bestätigte: \"Dies ist notwendig, um das öffentliche Vertrauen wiederherzustellen.\" Als der Enthüllungsbericht der New York Post vor den Wahlen im Jahr 2020 veröffentlicht wurde, zensierte Twitter die Geschichte, weil sie angeblich gegen die \"Hacked Materials Policy\" des Unternehmens verstieß. Praktisch alle Medien taten es Twitter gleich und zensierten die Laptop-Geschichte. Ehemalige führende US-Geheimdienstler bezeichneten die in dem Artikel veröffentlichten Rechercheergebnisse gar als russische Propaganda.Raise your hand if you think @ElonMusk should make public all internal discussions about the decision to censor the @NYPost's story on Hunter Biden's laptop before the 2020 Election in the interest of Transparency.— ALX 🇺🇸 #BringThemBack  (@alx) November 24, 2022Zahlreiche US-Medien haben in den vergangenen Monaten eine komplette Kehrtwende vollzogen. Sowohl die New York Times als auch die Washington Post, NBC News und Politico bestätigten zuletzt, dass der Inhalt des Laptops authentisch ist. Auch der ehemalige Twitter-CEO Jack Dorsey räumte inzwischen ein, dass es ein Fehler gewesen sei, sich in die Hunter-Biden-Story einzumischen. Heute weiß man, dass die Zensur des Artikels offenbar auf den Druck des FBI zurückgeht. Dies enthüllte Meta-Chef Mark Zuckerberg zu Beginn des Jahres in einem Gespräch mit dem US-Podcaster Joe Rogan:\"Das FBI kam zu uns und versezte uns in Alarmbereitschaft. Die Wahlen 2016 seien von russischer Propaganda beeinflusst worden und das Gleiche könnte jetzt wieder passieren.\"Zuckerberg betonte, dass er die Warnung einer so wichtigen Behörde wie des FBI ernst genommen habe. Facebook sei nicht direkt vor dieser Geschichte gewarnt worden, erklärte der Meta CEO. Sie habe jedoch genau in das Muster gepasst, welches das FBI ihnen geschildert habe.Aufgrund der sogenannten Laptop-Affäre steht US-Präsident Joe Biden unter anderem im Verdacht, durch ausländische Geldgeber beeinflusst worden zu sein. Dutzende Millionen Dollar sollen demnach von ausländischen Interessengruppen und Regierungen auf die Bankkonten seines Sohnes überwiesen worden sein. Im Gegenzug sollen die Geldgeber anschließend Zugang zu Joe Biden selbst sowie weitere Vorteile – etwa bei Geschäften – erhalten haben.  Unternehmen in China, Russland, der Ukraine, Kasachstan, Rumänien und mehreren anderen Ländern haben laut den von der New York Post analysierten Daten auf Hunter Bidens Laptop Geld an Biden gezahlt, von dem auch sein Vater profitiert haben soll. Angeblich kamen allein aus China 30 Millionen Dollar und weitere rund 11 Millionen Dollar aus der Ukraine. Niemand, weder das Weiße Haus noch Hunter Biden selbst, bestreitet die Echtheit der Daten, die zuerst auf 4chan gepostet wurden. Eine umfangreiche Sammlung von Dokumenten und belastenden Aussagen eines früheren Geschäftspartners Hunters beweisen zudem, dass der US-Präsident von den lukrativen Machenschaften seines Sohnes gewusst haben muss.Auch belegen Besucherprotokolle, dass sich Joe Biden während seiner Zeit in der Obama-Regierung wiederholt mit den Partnern seines Sohnes traf. Zudem werfen Geschäfte in der Ukraine Fragen auf. Hunter Biden hatte zwischen 2014 und 2019 einen lukrativen Posten im Aufsichtsrat des ukrainischen Gaskonzerns Burisma inne, während Joe Biden als US-Vizepräsident federführend für die Ukraine zuständig war. Angesichts der politischen Brisanz wollen sich nun auch die Republikaner im Repräsentantenhaus mit den Auslandsgeschäften der Bidens befassen. Spätestens im Januar soll das neu eingesetzte House Oversight Committee das US-Finanzministerium dazu auffordern, die mehr als 150 Verdachtsmeldungen (Suspicious Activity Reports – SARs) vorzulegen, die belegen, dass Biden Millionen von Dollar von ausländischen Konten überwiesen bekam. Die US-Banken hatten damals eine beträchtliche Anzahl dieser Transaktionen gemeldet und auch die Abteilung für Finanzkriminalität des US-Finanzministeriums informiert. Mehr zum Thema - Washington Post: Genug Beweise für Anklage gegen Hunter Biden wegen SteuerdeliktenDurch die Sperrung von RT zielt die EU darauf ab, eine kritische, nicht prowestliche Informationsquelle zum Schweigen zu bringen.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) by: HOPE YEN, Associated Press Posted: Nov 28, 2022 / 04:48 AM CST Updated: Nov 28, 2022 / 10:29 AM CST WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is strengthening U.S. policy aimed at stemming sexual violence in war conflict zones, elevating the problem — increasingly documented in Ukraine and elsewhere — to the level of a possible serious human rights abuse that triggers sanctions and other actions against foreign perpetrators. Biden on Monday signed a presidential memorandum that seeks to combat the use of rape by both foreign governments and individuals as a weapon of war. The memorandum directs for the first time that the State and Treasury departments and other agencies give equal consideration of acts of sexual violence to other serious human rights abuses in leveraging sanctions and other punishment against foreign actors. Currently, U.S. policy allows for the imposition of sanctions for conflict-related sexual violence, but it is not commonly used. Biden's action comes when the United Nations has warned that sexual violence in Ukraine, especially against women and girls, remains prevalent and underreported. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield has previously cited 'a mountain of credible reports of atrocities committed by Russia's forces against civilians,' including 'horrific accounts of sexual violence.' The Biden administration on Monday pointed to a proliferation of sexual violence cases in Ukraine, Ethiopia and elsewhere. It cited a U.N. report that found 3,293 verified sexual violence cases in 2021 across 18 countries, an increase of about 800 compared with the previous year. The U.N. has estimated that for each rape reported in connection with a conflict, about 10 to 20 cases go undocumented. The administration had previously pledged $400,000 in addition to its annual contribution of $1.75 million to the Office of the U.N. Special Representative to the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. The State Department plans an added investment of $5.5 million over the next two years to civil society projects and survivor groups seeking sexual violence accountability and will expand programs to help survivors and investigate and document acts of such violence.

If this president was actually in his right mind, I don't think he would have approved this.

Well, I suggest that now that Joe Biden has been as tough as he can possibly be in his own mind, that the federal government now checks out every checking and savings account owned by Biden to see if there's a little spare change in there somewhere.\n\nWhy charge for paper not received?\n\nHey Lake County News-Sun and Tribune company in particular again, another damn puzzle.

(REUTERS Photo) The U.S. House of Representatives minority Republican leader said Tuesday he is \"not for a blank check for anything\" concerning American aid to Ukraine. \"This is hard-working taxpayer money. And I want to make sure whatever funding we spend goes to the right places,\" Kevin McCarthy told reporters following a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House. Biden hosted congressional leaders at the White House, including Democratic Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Republican Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and McCarthy. Ukraine aid was at stake during the Nov. 8 midterm elections as Biden repeatedly expressed concerns about the future of U.S. aid to Ukraine under a Republican-controlled Congress. His fears were given credence by former President Donald Trump, who criticized Congress for approving a $40 billion aid package for Ukraine when \"America's parents are struggling to even feed their children.\" Multiple Republican members of Congress also said U.S. aid to Ukraine should be curtailed or halted, including McCarthy, who said in an interview: \"I think people are gonna be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. They just won't do it.\"",

      "summary": "Trong cuộc bầu cử giữa nhiệm kỳ Mỹ 2022, đảng Cộng hoà đã giành được thế đa số tại Hạ viện và sẽ tiếp quản cơ quan này từ ngày 3/1/2023. Điều này được đánh giá sẽ gây khó khăn cho chương trình nghị sự của Tổng thống Mỹ Joe Biden trong vòng 2 năm tới. Trong khi đó, đảng Dân chủ vẫn giữ quyền kiểm soát Thượng viện. \nNgày 29/11, Tổng thống Joe Biden đã có cuộc hội đàm tại Nhà Trắng với các nhà lãnh đạo đảng Dân chủ và đảng Cộng hoà về kế hoạch hành động trước khi đảng Cộng hoà nắm quyền kiểm soát Hạ viện vào đầu năm tới, Reuters đưa tin.\n\nTổng thống Mỹ Joe Biden. Ảnh: Reuters.\n\nCác thành viên đảng Dân chủ cho biết trong cuộc họp, ngân sách cho việc đảm bảo tăng cường viện trợ quân sự tới Ukraine và ứng phó dịch bệnh COVID-19 là những ưu tiên hàng đầu của Quốc hội trong thời gian trước khi đảng Cộng hoà kiểm soát Hạ viện. \nCác nhà lãnh đạo hàng đầu nước Mỹ cũng thảo luận về biện pháp ngăn chặn một cuộc đình công của ngành đường sắt cũng như ngân sách tạm thời cho tới 16/12 để chính phủ không phải đóng cửa.\nLiên quan đến tình hình viện trợ quân sự của Mỹ tới Ukraine, ngày 28/11, Lầu Năm Góc đang xem xét đề xuất của Boeing về việc cung cấp cho Ukraine những quả bom chính xác cỡ nhỏ, giá rẻ được gắn vào số lượng lớn các tên lửa sẵn có, cho phép Kiev tấn công phía sau các phòng tuyến của Nga. Thông báo được đưa ra trong bối cảnh phương Tây đang phải xoay xở để đáp ứng nhu cầu cung cấp thêm vũ khí của Ukraine. \nKho vũ khí quân sự của Mỹ và đồng minh hiện đang bị thu hẹp, trong khi Ukraine phải đối mặt với nhu cầu ngày càng tăng với các loại vũ khí tinh vi hơn do cuộc xung đột của Nga tiếp tục kéo dài. \nHệ thống sử dụng bom đường kính nhỏ (GLSDB) mà Boeing đề xuất là một trong nhiều loại vũ khí được đưa vào kế hoạch sản xuất để cung cấp cho Ukraine và các đồng minh của Mỹ ở Đông Âu. \nTheo Reuters, GLSDB có thể được chuyển giao sớm nhất đến Ukraine vào mùa xuân năm 2023. Hệ thống này kết hợp với Bom đường kính nhỏ GBU-39 (SDB) với động cơ tên lửa M26, cả hai đều phổ biến trong kho vũ khí của Mỹ.\nBích Thảo (Theo Reuters) Link nguồn: https://doisongphapluat.nguoiduatin.vn/dspl/my-uu-tien-ngan-sach-cho-covid-19-va-vien-tro-quan-su-toi-ukraine-a558890.html",

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) by: HOPE YEN, Associated Press Posted: Nov 28, 2022 / 04:51 AM CST Updated: Nov 28, 2022 / 10:28 AM CST WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is strengthening U.S. policy aimed at stemming sexual violence in war conflict zones, elevating the problem — increasingly documented in Ukraine and elsewhere — to the level of a possible serious human rights abuse that triggers sanctions and other actions against foreign perpetrators. Biden on Monday signed a presidential memorandum that seeks to combat the use of rape by both foreign governments and individuals as a weapon of war. The memorandum directs for the first time that the State and Treasury departments and other agencies give equal consideration of acts of sexual violence to other serious human rights abuses in leveraging sanctions and other punishment against foreign actors. Currently, U.S. policy allows for the imposition of sanctions for conflict-related sexual violence, but it is not commonly used. Biden's action comes when the United Nations has warned that sexual violence in Ukraine, especially against women and girls, remains prevalent and underreported. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield has previously cited 'a mountain of credible reports of atrocities committed by Russia's forces against civilians,' including 'horrific accounts of sexual violence.' The Biden administration on Monday pointed to a proliferation of sexual violence cases in Ukraine, Ethiopia and elsewhere. It cited a U.N. report that found 3,293 verified sexual violence cases in 2021 across 18 countries, an increase of about 800 compared with the previous year. The U.N. has estimated that for each rape reported in connection with a conflict, about 10 to 20 cases go undocumented. The administration had previously pledged $400,000 in addition to its annual contribution of $1.75 million to the Office of the U.N. Special Representative to the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. The State Department plans an added investment of $5.5 million over the next two years to civil society projects and survivor groups seeking sexual violence accountability and will expand programs to help survivors and investigate and document acts of such violence.
